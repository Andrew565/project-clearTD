# Clear the Dungeon - Rules

## Classic Version

**Designed & Written by Mark S. Ball**

### Overview

**Game Objective:** Destroy all of the dungeon monsters to win the game.

**Players:** 1 Player.

**Materials:** 54 card deck (Ace - King, two Jokers).

**Ranking:** (Low) Ace - King (High), Jokers are wild.

### Introduction

In **Clear the Dungeon**, you are a monster exterminator hired by the King. You must use powerful attacks and exploit monster weaknesses to clear dungeon cells before running out of power.

### Setup

1. **Separate the Decks:** Remove all face cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings) to form the **dungeon monster deck** (12 cards). The remaining cards (A-10 and Jokers) form your **power deck**.

2. **Dungeon Layout:** Shuffle the monster deck and deal four columns face down, with three cards in each column.

3. **Reveal Monsters:** Flip the top card of each column face up.

4. **Power Deck:** Shuffle the power deck and place it face down.

### Gameplay

Each turn consists of three phases: **Draw, Attack, & Discard**.

#### 1. Draw

Draw three cards from the power deck to form your hand. Every card must be played or discarded before you can draw again.

#### 2. Attack

Monsters have specific power levels: **Jacks (11), Queens (12), and Kings (13)**. To defeat a monster, you must use exactly **three cards**:

**Step 1 (Power):** The first two cards added together must equal or exceed the monster's power level. Suits do not matter for this step.

**Step 2 (Weakness):** The third card must match the monster's suit. Rank does not matter for this card.

**Resolution:** Once the third card is played, the monster is defeated. Move the monster and the three attack cards to your "clear pile".

#### 3. Discard (Damage Pile)

Cards that cannot or will not be played must be discarded. These form your **damage pile**.

**Lose Condition:** If your damage pile reaches **seven cards**, you lose immediately.

### Special Rules & Scoring

**Jokers:** Worth a power of 10 and can act as any suit.

**Reserve Card (Optional):** The top card of the discard pile can be used as if it were in your hand. When used, the next card in the pile becomes the new reserve.

**Winning:** Defeat all monsters before the power deck runs out.

**Scoring:** Your score is the number of cards remaining in your power deck. Cards in hand do not count.

**Difficulty:** Increase difficulty by removing Jokers or playing without the reserve card.
