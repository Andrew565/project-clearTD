# Clear the Dungeon - Advanced

**Clear the Dungeon Advanced** introduces a complex dungeon layout, item collection, and special abilities.

## Setup

**Monster Deck:** Includes face cards (J, Q, K) AND both Jokers (14 cards total).

**Power Deck:** Consists of cards Ace through 10 (A-10).

**Dungeon Layout:** Cards are dealt face down in a specific overlapping pyramid-like structure:

Row 1: [X]

Row 2: [X] [X]

Row 3: [X] [X] [X]

Row 4: [X] [X]

Row 5: [X]

Row 6: [X] [X]

Row 7: [X] [X] [X]

**Reveal:** Reveal the bottom three monster cards to begin. As face-down cards are completely uncovered, reveal them immediately.

## Advanced Mechanics

**Hit Row:** Discarded cards are placed in a row to the right. You lose immediately upon taking your **fifth hit**.

**Hit Row Draw:** If you play all three cards from your hand, immediately draw three more and continue your turn.

**Item Cards (Kings):** When a King is defeated, it moves to your **inventory row** rather than the clear pile. Each suit provides a one-time ability:
**King of Spades ():** Place one card from your hand at the bottom of the power deck.

**King of Hearts ():** Look at the bottom card of the power deck; you may move it to the top.

**King of Clubs ():** Double the value of an attack card.

**King of Diamonds ():** Immediately draw one card from the power deck.

**Advanced Jokers:** When revealed in the dungeon, Jokers are added to your hand immediately. They are power 10 and wild suits.

## Winning (Advanced)

Defeat all monsters before receiving five hits.
