## How to Play

Destroy all of the dungeon monsters to win the game. You are a monster exterminator hired by the King. You must use powerful attacks and exploit monster weaknesses to clear dungeon cells before running out of power.

### Setup

The dungeon has four columns of monsters. Each column has three cards, with the top card revealed.

### How to Attack

To defeat a monster (Jack: 11, Queen: 12, King: 13), you must use exactly **three cards**:

1. **Step 1 (Power):** The first two cards added together must equal or exceed the monster's power level.
2. **Step 2 (Weakness):** The third card must match the monster's suit.

Jokers are worth 10 power and can act as any suit.

### Damage & Survival

Cards that cannot be played must be discarded to your damage pile. If your damage pile reaches **7 cards**, you lose.

### Winning

Defeat all monsters before the power deck runs out. Your score is the number of cards remaining in your power deck.
